<table style="width:100%">

<tr>
<td>Stand-alone mode</td>
<td>Turn off if you are an organisation looking after several patients. Turn on if you are an individual looking after one or just a few patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient's name</td>
<td>This is any name that you wish to use to identify the patient. It should be quite short.
</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Patient's Cyfer Health Email Address</td>
<td>Each patient must be given a unique GMail email address. (This should not be their personal or any other existing email address.) You should create a new Google account for the patient and enter the email address associated with that new account.</td>
</tr>
<td>Patient's Email Password</td>
<td>The app password associated with the patient's Cyfer Health email address. This is not the Google account password! The app password must be created within the Security settings page of the patients Google account. See here for me info XXXXXXXXXXX</td>
</tr>
<td>Centre's Email Address</td>
<td>(Only relevant if Stand-alone mode is off.) The email address of your organisation's CYfer Health Server.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Emergency Email Address(es)</td>
<td>The email addresses of any carers that you wish to receive emails with various alerts that are generated by Cyfer Health Client, such as unusually low or high heart readings.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Send summary email at</td>
<td>A daily summary email can be generated and sent to the Emergency Email Addresses. If that is required, enter the time at which the email should be sent. Setting the time at 8am, for example, will produce an email that summarises the events between 8am the previous day and 8am on the current day.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>How often, in days, to email all readings</td>
<td>An email with all heart rate readings (which may be captured at a higher frequency than that sent to the Centre) can be sent to the Emergency Email Addresses. If required, enter the number of consecutive days to capture before sending an email.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Low heart alert</td>
<td>The heart rate, e.g. 35 beats per minute, below which an email alert should be generated.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>High heart alert</td>
<td>The heart rate, e.g. 150 beats per minute, above which an email alert should be generated.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Sound alarm</td>
<td>Switch on if you require an alarm to sound on the Cyfer Health Client device if either a low or high heart alert is generated. (You are unlikely to want to switch this on. It is mainly of interest if you are using the app to mintor your own heart.)</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Set max alarm volume</td>
<td>Switch on if you want the alarm volume (played when the Cyfer Health Client receives a message) to be set to maximum. This can be useful if the patient may have accidentally lowered or muted the volume of the alarm.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Turn off Do Not Disturb</td>
<td>As for 'Set max alarm volume', it can be useful to switch this option in to address the case where the patient may have accidentally turned on Android's |do Not Disturb function.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Start Watchdog</td>
<td>Start the optional Cyfer Watchdog app and ensure that the Watchdog continues to run. (The Watchdog app ensures that the Cyfer Client Health app is running.)</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Only trusted email addresses</td>
<td>Only process emails (such as messages) from addresses that you trust. These are the email addresses specified in the above 'Emergency Email Address(es)' entry and, if you are not using Stand-alone mode, the Cyfer Health Server's email address.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Debug email</td>
<td>Do not use this setting. It is only for the app's developer.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Scan button</td>
<td>Initiate scaning for the patient's Bluetooth health band.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Patient's band</td>
<td>Select (by tapping) the list entry that corresponds to the patient's health band. The text of the selected band will be become bold. If you select the wrong entry, select again.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Use emergency button</td>
<td>Turn on if the patient has a Bluetooth emergency button that can operate with Cyfer Health Client.</td>
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
<td>Emergency button</td>
<td>As for the patient's band, select the list entry that corresponds to the patient's emergency button.</td>
</tr>

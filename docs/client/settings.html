<h1>Cyfer Health Client</h1>
<h3>Cyfer Health's Document Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Patient</i> is the person being looked after. Unless you are a professional carer you probably don't think of this person as a 'patient' but instead they are a relative or a friend to whom you feel responsible, in some way, for their welfare.</p>
<p><i>Carer</i> is the person looking after the <i>patient</i>. This documentation assumes that the reader is the <i>Carer</i> so when 'you' is used, it is referring to the role of the <i>Carer</i>.</p>
<p>There will often be more than one <i>Carer</i>, e.g. siblings looking after a parent; and within a health care organisation there is likely to be a large number of <i>Carers</i>. Likewise, within such a care organisation, there are likely to be a large number of <i>Patients</i>.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>The settings and commands available on the Settings page.</p>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td>Check-box button at top of page</td>
<td>Tap to test the email settings that have been entered on this page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Padlock button at top of page</td>
<td>Tap to set the PIN that controls access to this page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power button at top of page</td>
<td>Tap to stop Cyfer Health Client running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stand-alone mode</td>
<td>Turn off if you are an organisation looking after several patients. Turn on if you are an individual looking after one or just a few patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient's name</td>
<td>This is the name you wish to use to identify the patient. It should be quite short. (Less than 10 characters).</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Patient's Cyfer Health Email Address</td>
<td>Each patient must be given a unique GMail email address. (This should not be their personal or any other existing email address.) You should create a new Google account for the patient and then use the email address associated with that new account here.</td>
</tr>
<td>Patient's Email Password</td>
<td>The app password associated with the patient's Cyfer Health email address. This is not the Google account password! The app password is generated from within the Security settings page of the patient's Google account. See here for more info XXXXXXXXXXX</td>
</tr>
<td>Centre's Email Address</td>
<td>(Only relevant if Stand-alone mode is off.) The email address of your organisation's Cyfer Health Server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emergency Email Address(es)</td>
<td>The email addresses of any carers that should receive alert emails that are generated by Cyfer Health Client, such as unusually low or high heart readings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Send summary email at</td>
<td>A daily summary email can be generated and sent to the Emergency Email Addresses. If that is required, enter the time at which the email should be generated and sent. Setting the time at 8am, for example, will produce an email that summarises the events between 8am the previous day and 8am on the current day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How often, in days, to email all readings</td>
<td>An email with all heart rate readings (which may be of a higher frequency than that sent to the Centre) can be sent to the Emergency Email Addresses. The attached file of readings can be analysed in an application such as Excel. If this is required, enter the number of consecutive days to capture before sending an email.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low heart alert</td>
<td>The heart rate, e.g. 35 beats per minute, below which an email alert should be generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High heart alert</td>
<td>The heart rate, e.g. 150 beats per minute, above which an email alert should be generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sound alarm</td>
<td>Switch on if you require an alarm to sound on the Cyfer Health Client device if either a low or high heart alert is detected. (You are unlikely to want to switch this on. It is mainly of interest if you are using the app to monitor your own heart.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set max alarm volume</td>
<td>Switch on if you want the volume of the alarm (played when the Cyfer Health Client receives a message) to be set to maximum. This can be useful if the patient has accidentally lowered or muted their device's volume settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Turn off Do Not Disturb</td>
<td>As for 'Set max alarm volume', it can be useful to switch this option on to address the case where the patient has accidentally turned on Android's Do Not Disturb function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start Watchdog</td>
<td>Start the optional Cyfer Watchdog app and ensure that the Watchdog continues to run. (The Watchdog app ensures that the Cyfer Client Health app is operational. It is a reciprocal action, Watchdog ensures Cyfer Health Client stays operational and Cyfer Health Client ensures Watchdog stays operational.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Only trusted email addresses</td>
<td>If on, only process emails (such as messages) from email addresses that you trust. These are the email addresses specified in the above 'Emergency Email Address(es)' entry and, if you are not using Stand-alone mode, the Cyfer Health Server's email address. This reduces signifcantly the risk of the patient's devices being spammed with unwanted email. However, even without switching this on, spamming is unlikley since the Cyfer Health emails have a dedicated format and the patient's Cyfer email address is never published so shouldn't be picked up by spammers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Debug email</td>
<td>Do not use this setting. It is only for the app's developer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scan button</td>
<td>Initiate scanning for the patient's Bluetooth health band.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient's band</td>
<td>Select (by tapping) the list entry that corresponds to the patient's health band. The text of the selected band will become bold. If you select the wrong entry, select again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use emergency button</td>
<td>Turn on if the patient has a Bluetooth emergency button that can operate with Cyfer Health Client.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emergency button</td>
<td>As for specifying the patient's health band, select the list entry that corresponds to the patient's emergency button.</td>
</tr>

<h1>Cyfer Health Client</h1>
<h3>Cyfer Health's Document Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Patient</i> is the person being looked after. Unless you are a professional carer you probably don't think of this person as a 'patient' but instead they are a relative or a friend to whom you feel responsible, in some way, for their welfare.</p>
<p><i>Carer</i> is the person looking after the <i>patient</i>. This documentation assumes that the reader is the <i>Carer</i> so when 'you' is used, it is referring to the role of the <i>Carer</i>.</p>
<p>There will often be more than one <i>Carer</i>, e.g. siblings looking after a parent; and within a health care organisation there is likely to be a large number of <i>Carers</i>. Likewise, within such a care organisation, there are likely to be a large number of <i>Patients</i>.</p>

<h3>The settings and commands available on the Settings page.</h3>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td>Stand-alone mode</td>
<td>Turn off if you are an organisation looking after several patients. Turn on if you are an individual looking after one or just a few patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient's name</td>
<td>This is the name you wish to use to identify the patient. It should be quite short. (Less than 10 characters).</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Patient's Cyfer Health Email Address</td>
<td>Each patient must be given a unique GMail email address. (This should not be their personal or any other existing email address.) You should create a new Google account for the patient and then use the email address associated with that new account here.</td>
</tr>
<td>Patient's Email Password</td>
<td>The app password associated with the patient's Cyfer Health email address. This is not the Google account password! The app password is generated from within the Security settings page of the patient's Google account. See here for more info XXXXXXXXXXX</td>
</tr>
<td>Centre's Email Address</td>
<td>(Only relevant if Stand-alone mode is off.) The email address of your organisation's Cyfer Health Server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emergency Email Address(es)</td>
<td>The email addresses of any carers that should receive alert emails that are generated by Cyfer Health Client, such as unusually low or high heart readings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Send summary email at</td>
<td>A daily summary email can be generated and sent to the Emergency Email Addresses. If that is required, enter the time at which the email should be generated and sent. Setting the time at 8am, for example, will produce an email that summarises the events between 8am the previous day and 8am on the current day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How often, in days, to email all readings</td>
<td>An email with all heart rate readings (which may be of a higher frequency than that sent to the Centre) can be sent to the Emergency Email Addresses. The attached file of readings can be analysed in an application such as Excel. If this is required, enter the number of consecutive days to capture before sending an email.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low heart alert</td>
<td>The heart rate, e.g. 35 beats per minute, below which an email alert should be generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High heart alert</td>
<td>The heart rate, e.g. 150 beats per minute, above which an email alert should be generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sound alarm</td>
<td>Switch on if you require an alarm to sound on the Cyfer Health Client device if either a low or high heart alert is detected. (You are unlikely to want to switch this on. It is mainly of interest if you are using the app to monitor your own heart.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set max alarm volume</td>
<td>Switch on if you want the volume of the alarm (played when the Cyfer Health Client receives a message) to be set to maximum. This can be useful if the patient has accidentally lowered or muted their device's volume settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset volume</td>
<td>After setting maximum volume (if the above setting is enabled), return the volume to its previous value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Turn off Do Not Disturb</td>
<td>As for 'Set max alarm volume', it can be useful to switch this option on to address the case where the patient has accidentally turned on Android's Do Not Disturb function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start Watchdog</td>
<td>Start the optional Cyfer Watchdog app and ensure that the Watchdog continues to run. The Watchdog app ensures that the Cyfer Client Health app is operational. (It is a reciprocal relationship: Watchdog ensures Cyfer Health Client stays operational and Cyfer Health Client ensures Watchdog stays operational.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Only trusted email addresses</td>
<td>If on, only process emails (such as messages) from email addresses that you trust. These are the email addresses specified in the above 'Emergency Email Address(es)' entry and, if you are not using Stand-alone mode, the Cyfer Health Server's email address. This reduces significantly the risk of the patient's devices being spammed with unwanted email. However, even without switching this on, spamming is unlikley since the Cyfer Health emails have a dedicated format and the patient's Cyfer email address is never published so shouldn't be picked up by spammers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show name</td>
<td>Show the patient's name on the main (graph) page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show steps</td>
<td>Show the number of steps the patient has taken today, if available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(Advanced) Debug email</td>
<td>Do not use this setting. It is only for the app's developer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(Advanced) Start third-party app</td>
<td>(Only works if using the non-lite version of Watchdog.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient's band</td>
<td>Initiate scanning for the patient's Bluetooth health band. Then select (by tapping) the list entry that corresponds to the patient's health band. (The text of the currently selected band will be bold.) If you select the wrong entry, try again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use emergency button</td>
<td>Turn on if the patient has a Bluetooth emergency button that can operate with Cyfer Health Client. Once configured, pressing the emergency button will send an email to the emergency address(es) and sound an alarm within the Cyfer Health Monitor app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emergency button</td>
<td>As for specifying the patient's health band, select the list entry that corresponds to the patient's emergency button.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Emergency Button</h2>
<p>Most simple Bluetooth 'button' devices can be used as an Emergency Button. A typical such device is a remote shutter release button that can be bought for a few pounds. One device can be used simultaneously with a Cyfer Health Client app and any number of Cyfer Health Alert apps. (Provided the button is running in unpaired mode - see below.) Placing devices running Cyfer Health Alert around the patient's home ensures that, even if the patient is not close to their phone running Cyfer Health Client, the emergency button is always detectable.</p>
<p>The button device can operate in two different modes. A mode where it is paired with the patient's device (this is typically how Bluetooth devices such as headphones are connected to mobile phones); and a mode where it is unpaired. The advantage of being paired is that the button will be more response (it can be pressed as many times as desired), whereas if it is unpaired, it can only be pressed once every 10 minutes. The problem with the paired mode, is that some buttons may not be detectable by the Cyfer Health Client app. In these cases, obviously, the unpaired mode should be used. In practice, it is very unlikely that an emergency button would need to be pressed more frequently than once every few hours.</p>
<p>To configure a button in paired mode, first pair the button with the patient's device (typically via Android's Bluetooth settings screen) and then select the button from the drop-down list within Cyfer Health Client apps's Settings page. You can then test it by pressing the button. If a test message is not displayed, consider using unpaired mode.</p>
<p>To configure a button in unpaired mode, don't pair the button with the patient's device and if you have already paired it, use Android's Bluetooth settings to unpair it. Once it is definitely unpaired, select the button from the drop-down list within Cyfer Health Client apps's Settings page. The button is likely to have an indicator (often a blue LED) that flashes when the button is active. Once this indicator is no longer lit, you can test the button by pressing it. The indicator will start flashing again and Cyfer Health Client app should show a confirmation message. You will need to wait at least 10 minutes before the button will allow another emergency alert to be generated.</p>

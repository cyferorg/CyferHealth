<h1>Cyfer Health Alerts</h1>
<h3>Cyfer Health's Document Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Patient</i> is the person being looked after. Unless you are a professional carer you probably don't think of this person as a 'patient' but instead they are a relative or a friend to whom you are responsible for their welfare.</p>
<p><i>Carer</i> is the person looking after the <i>patient</i>. This documentation assumes that the reader is the <i>Carer</i> so when 'you' is used, it is referring to the role of the <i>Carer</i>.</p>
<p>There will often be more than one <i>Carer</i>, e.g. siblings looking after a parent; and within a health care organisation there is likely to be a large number of <i>Carers</i>. Likewise, within such a care organisation, there are likely to be a large number of <i>Patients</i>.</p>
<h2>Message screen</h2>
<p>This is the only screen that the patient will see and interact with. It is optional, but the Cyfer Health Alerts app is usually the only app visible on the device. Hence, the Message screen will be always visible to the patient apart from any device screen-off settings.</p>
<p>This screen displays messages sent by carers. Each message is scaled to take up the entire display apart from a small margin at the bottom to the screen to help show there is more than one message is available. When a message arrives the screen turns-on (if off) and flashes, and optionally an alarm is sounded. (The message will also be displayed on the patient's Cyfer Health Client app.) Tapping the message on the Alert app or Client app stops the flashing and turns-off the alarm. If the Carer who sent the message has requested a response, the patient will be prompted to tap one of the response buttons. Even when the Carer has not requested a response, an email will still be sent to them to indicate that the Patient has tapped the message. Once the Patient has read the message, they can either delete it by tapping the bin icon or just leave it. In case of the latter, any new messages will be made visible and old messages scrolled off the screen.</p>
<div id="settingstable">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>In order to remove clutter form the main screen, there isn't a button to access the Settings page from the main screen. (As well as removing clutter, it also reduces the likelihood of the Patient inadvertently changing the app's settings.) Instead, the app's notification should be dragged down and the Settings button, which will become visible, should be pressed.</p>
<p>The settings and commands available on the Settings page.</p>
<table style="width:100%">
There are three buttons on the top of the Settings page:
<tr>
<td>Check box</td>
<td>Tap to check the email address and password. If the settings work, the icon will go green.</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Padlock</td>
<td>Tap to set or remove PIN access to the Settings page. Enter a value of 0000 to remove the requirement to enter a PIN.</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Power off</td>
<td>Tap to shutdown the Cyfer Health Alerts app.</td>
</tr> 
</table>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Device name</td>
<td>This is the name you wish to use to identify the <i>device</i>. A good approach is to name the device after its location, e.g. bedroom or living room. It should be quite short. (Less than 10 characters).</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Patient's Cyfer Health Email Address</td>
<td>Enter the patient's Cyfer Health Client email address. This is the Google email address you will have created when setting-up their Cyfer Health Client app.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient's Email Password</td>
<td>Enter the patient's Cyfer Health Client email app password. This is the same password you will have created when setting-up their Cyfer Health Client app.</td>
</tr>
<td>Debug email</td>
<td>Ignore this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Always display on top</td>
<td>Switching this on ensures that the Cyfer Health Alert app is always visible. If the app is running on a dedicated device then it would be best to enable this setting. If the app is on a device that is used for other things e.g. reading email, then the setting should be switched off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set max alarm volume</td>
<td>Switch on if you want the volume of the alarm (played when the Cyfer Health Client receives a message) to be set to maximum. This can be useful if the patient has accidentally lowered or muted their device's volume settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset volume</td>
<td>If <i>Set max alarm volume</i> is enabled, enabling <i>Reset volume</i> will restore the device's alarm volume setting to its value before the alarm was sounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Always keep lock on</td>
<td>This should only be enabled if the device Cyfer Health Alerts is running on loses network connection. This only seems to occur on a small number of older devices. To test if it is required, leave the device over night and then send a message. If the device detects the message, it is unlikely that the setting is required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignore lock during night</td>
<td>This setting is only relevant if <i>Always keep lock on</i> is enabled. If <i>Always keep lock on</i> is enabled, you will probably find that the device's screen is turned on every few hours before turning off again. This can be distracting if the device is near the patient's bed and the environment is dark. In such a situation, turn on <i>Ignore lock during night</i>. When on, the device's screen will no longer light-up over-night. However, the device might not receive messages during the night. As mitigation for this issue, it is unlikely that messages would need to be sent to the patient while they are, or should be, sleeping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Turn off Do Not Disturb</td>
<td>(This setting might not be available) Allows Cyfer Health Alerts to turn off Android's Do Not Disturb (DND) function. DND may have been accidentally switched on by the Patient or may be turned on a timer in order, for example, not to disturb the patient overnight with unimportant notification sounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Only trusted email addresses</td>
<td>If on, only process emails (such as messages) from email addresses that you trust. These are the email addresses specified in the above 'Emergency Email Address(es)' entry and, if you are not using Stand-alone mode, the Cyfer Health Server's email address. This reduces signifcantly the risk of the patient's devices being spammed with unwanted email. However, even without switching this on, spamming is unlikley since the Cyfer Health emails have a dedicated format and the patient's Cyfer email address is never published so shouldn't be picked up by spammers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trusted email addresses</td>
<td>Enter the email addresses you wish to allow to send messages and commands to the patient. Separate each email by a comma, e.g. john@mail.com,jane.jones@yahoo.com,fredsmith@hotmail.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Select alarm</td>
<td>Choose the sound that should be played when a message is received. The sound should be one that is looped continuously rather than one that ends after a couple of seconds. If you want to set a particular volume for the alarm, start playing the alarm sound, then using the device's volume controls change the volume to the required colume, and then tap the <i>Set volume</i> button</td>.
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display orientation</td>
<td>Once the Cyfer Health Alerts app has started the device's screen orientation won't change, i.e. between landscape and portrait orientations. This is so that the patient is not confused or irritated by the screen's layout changing as they handle the device. The required orientation can have one of the following values: Automatic, Landscape, Portrait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use Emergency button</td>
<td>Switch on in order to use a Bluetooth emergency button. Then, once the button is active, i.e. prss the button, tap the Scan button and select the device in the drop-down list underneath the Scan button. </td>.
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emergency email addresses</td>
<td>A comma separated list of email addresses to which an email should be sent when the Patient presses their emergency button. Note that if you are using Cyfer Health Monitor, one of the addresses should be that of the Monitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete all messages</td>
<td>Delete all the received messages. If there are several messages, this message is much faster than deleting the individual messages.</td>
</tr>

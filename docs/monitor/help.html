<h1>Cyfer Health Monitor</h1>
<h3>Cyfer Health's Document Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Patient</i> is the person being looked after. Unless you are a professional carer you probably don't think of this person as a 'patient' but instead they are a relative or a friend to whom you are responsible for their welfare.</p>
<p><i>Carer</i> is the person looking after the <i>patient</i>. This documentation assumes that the reader is the <i>Carer</i> so when 'you' is used, it is referring to the role of the <i>Carer</i>.</p>
<p>There will often be more than one <i>Carer</i>, e.g. siblings looking after a parent; and within a health care organisation there is likely to be a large number of <i>Carers</i>. Likewise, within such a care organisation, there are likely to be a large number of <i>Patients</i>.</p>

<h2>Commands and Settings</h2>

<p>Cyfer Health Monitor is predominantly an app that just monitors the status of patients and hence once it has been set up the amount of Carer interaction with the app can be limited. The app's interface consists of a scrolling view of cards each of which provides details about a patient. As new patients are added to the system (i.e. a new patient's Cyfer Health Client app is started) the Monitor's list is updated automatically.</p>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td>Magnifying glass with minus icon</td>
<td>Reduces the size of the patient cards, allowing more cards to be viewed without the need to scroll.</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Magnifying glass with plus icon</td>
<td>Increases the size of the patient cards, providing easier viewing of each patients information however the Carere will need to scroll through the lsit to view all the patients' cards.</td>

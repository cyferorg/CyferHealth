<h2>Add Client/Patient contact details</h2>

<p>For every patient you wish to send messages, add their contact details by following these steps.</p>
<p>Enter a short name that you wish to use to identify them. Then tap the + icon.</p>
<p>Enter their Cyfer Health Client email address. This is the Google email address you will have used when setting their Cyfer Health Client app.</p>
<p>(Optional) Enter the phone number of the device they are using to run the Cyfer Health Client app. If you don't enter a phone number, you won't be able to use some advanced commands.</p>
<p>(Optional) Enter their PIN. If the Cyfer Health Client has a PIN set, then you must enter the same PIN in order to be able to send messages to them. (NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED.)</p>
<p>Tap the pencil inside a square icon to close the contact details. If you need to change the settings, tap the pencil icon again.</p>
<h2>Send a Client/Patient a message</h2>
<p>Only you have entered all the required contact details, select to whom you wish to send a message by selecting their name from the list. If you have entered only one person's contact details, this person will already be selected.</p>
<p>To identify yourself to the patient, enter a short name with which the patient will be familiar.</p>
<p>Enter the short message that you wish to send. The message should be short so that the patient doesn't get confused. Also, the message will be displayed on their device with a foint size that does not require scrolling. So the shorted the message, the large the font.</p>
<p>Optionally, enter one or two replies that the patient can select as a reply to your message. If this option is used, one or two buttons will be displayed on the client's device beneath the message. Depending on the patient, they may find this step too confusing.</p>
<p>As an example of a message using the optional replies: the message might read "I haven't heard from you for a while. Would you like me to come around?" and the replies would be given the text "Yes" and "No". Or, if you may feel that the patient may be more comfortable with: "Yes, please" and "No, I'm fine". However, the text of the replies should be short to aid in the patient reading the text of the replies that presented to them.</p>

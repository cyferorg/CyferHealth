<h1>Cyfer Health Remote</h1>
<h3>Cyfer Health's Document Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Patient</i> is the person being looked after. Unless you are a professional carer you probably don't think of this person as a 'patient' but instead they are a relative or a friend to whom you are responsible for their welfare.</p>
<p><i>Carer</i> is the person looking after the <i>patient</i>. This documentation assumes that the reader is the <i>Carer</i> so when 'you' is used, it is referring to the role of the <i>Carer</i>.</p>
<p>There will often be more than one <i>Carer</i>, e.g. siblings looking after a parent; and within a health care organisation there is likely to be a large number of <i>Carers</i>. Likewise, within such a care organisation, there are likely to be a large number of <i>Patients</i>.</p>
<h2>Add Patient contact details</h2>

<p>For every patient you wish to send messages, add their contact details by following these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter a short name (less than 10 characters) with which you can identify them (e.g. Dad). Then tap the + icon.</li>
<li>Enter their Cyfer Health Client email address. This is the Google email address you will have created when setting-up their Cyfer Health Client app.</li>
<li>(Optional) Enter the phone number of the device running the Cyfer Health Client app. If you don't enter a phone number, you won't be able to use some of the advanced commands.</li>
<li>(Optional) Enter their PIN. If the Cyfer Health Client has a PIN set, you must enter the same PIN here in order for your messages to be received by them. (NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED.)</li>
<li>Tap the pencil inside a square icon to close the contact details. If you need to change the settings, tap the pencil icon again.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>If you ever wish to remove a patient and their contact details, select their name in the list and tap the bin icon.</p>
<h2>Send a Patient a message</h2>
<p>Using the list of patients you have created, select the patient to whom you wish to send a message. If you have entered only one person's contact details, that person will already be selected.</p>
<p>To identify yourself to the patient when they receive the message, enter your name in a form with which the patient will be familiar. However, make it as short as possible so the font used when it is displayed to the patient is not too small.</p>
<p>Enter the short message that you wish to send. The message should be short so that the patient doesn't get confused by a lot of text. Also, the message will be displayed on their device using a font size that ensures the message does not require scrolling, i.e. the message can be fully displayed within the height of their device's screen. The shorter the message, the larger the font used.</p>
<p>Optionally, create one or two replies that the patient can send as a reply to your message. If this option is used, a corresponding number of buttons will be displayed on the patients's device beneath your message. However, depending on the patient, they may find this step too confusing. Even if replies are not set, you will receive an email when the patient has read the message.</p>
<p>As an example of a message using the optional replies: the message might read "I haven't heard from you for a while. Should I come around?" and the replies might be "Yes" and "No". Or, you feel that the patient would be be more comfortable with the more polite: "Yes, please" and "No, I'm fine". However, the text of the replies should be short to aid in the patient reading the text of the replies presented to them.</p>
